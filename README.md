# Tidy Tuesdays

This is the source for all submissions that I attempt for [Tidy Tuesdays](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), an R4DS community project dedicated to improving skills in visualizing, cleaning, and modeling data. 

Personally, this will serve as a launching point for a portfolio of work which I intend to integrate with my personal website. I will make all of the scripts available here, and my idea is to have some write-ups of the more involved scripts over on my blogdown site.
